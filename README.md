# Bomboclat
Bomboclat comes from Jamaican English. The term has been recorded since the 1950s but likely was in use before then. It is based on bumbo, a coarse patois term for female genitalia, and claat, a Jamaican type of cloth. Combined, the words literally mean “menstrual cloth,” but early evidence for bomboclat suggests it has denigrated someone or something as “contemptible” from or close to the start. 

# Rasclat
"Rasclat" is a term that originated in Jamaican English and has been used since the 1950s in the UK as well. It is a deeply offensive and derogatory term. The term is derived from the Jamaican Creole word "raasclaat," which is a combination of the English words "arse" and "cloth".
